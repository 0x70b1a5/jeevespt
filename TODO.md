# TODOs
- Let's make a new feature for Jeeves.  We're going to create Tasks.  They work like Reminders, except they're recurring.  A Task has a unique name, a description, a rotating log of outputs, and a frequency.  When the timer pops, Jeeves will perform the task per the description, with his previous outputs of that task passed as context, and then post a message to his default channel.  
    - Refactor Reminders to be auto-expiring Tasks?
- "look at this webpage" that isn't musing
    - code in tool use instead of home rolling the get?
